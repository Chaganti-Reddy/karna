Our goal is to support docs-as-code workflows with tens of thousands of pages, without compromising performance or usability.</p> <p>To make the transition seamless, compatibility comes first. We're putting significant effort into ensuring a smooth migration from Material for MkDocs for all users.

However, in recent years, it has become apparent that we were running up against limitations of our core dependency, MkDocs. These limitations proved impossible to overcome as they are deeply rooted in its architecture.</p> <p>We also mentioned in our update on our foundational work that MkDocs must be considered a supply chain risk, since it's unmaintained since August 2024. It has seen no releases in over a year and is accumulating unresolved issues and pull requests. These developments have forced us to cut our ties to MkDocs as a dependency.</p> <p>In order to map out a path forward, we went back to the drawing board, talked to dozens of our professional users and thoroughly analyzed the MkDocs ecosystem. We didn't just want to create a fork or port of MkDocs, but decided to rethink static site generation from first principles.</p> <p>With Zensical, we are creating a modern static site generator, which is compatible with your content and customizations, and addresses MkDocs' limitations. While Material for MkDocs is built on top of MkDocs, Zensical consolidates both projects into one coherent stack, covering static site generation, theming, and customization. What you can expect today:</p> <ul> <li>5x faster rebuilds</li> <li>Modern design</li> <li>Blazing-fast search</li> </ul> <p>Although we haven't reached full feature parity yet, you can already use Zensical to build your existing Material for MkDocs projects with minimal changes.</p> <p>You can jump to the compatibility section to learn what is already supported.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/05/zensical/#what-you-can-expect","title":"What you can expect","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/11/05/zensical/#solid-foundation","title":"Solid foundation","text":"<p>Our goal with Zensical is to create a coherent and modern stack, vertically integrating all parts of the authoring experience (AX), developer experience (DX), and user experience (UX). This gives us a significant competitive advantage over solutions that overly rely on third-party frameworks and dependencies, helping us to create much more robust Open Source software.</p> <p>ZRX, our new differential build engine, creates a solid foundation for Zensical, and is an Open Source project of its own. It's a fresh take on making differential data flows easy to build and a joy to work with. Most engineering effort has gone into ZRX, as it forms the backbone of Zensical, and will allow us to ship features faster.</p> <p>Following the principle of architectural hoisting, we moved essential, reusable functionality into ZRX, which allows us to keep Zensical's core simple and focused on static site generation.

Markdown rendering needs to go through Python Markdown, which forces us to pay for extra marshalling costs.</p> <p>While the initial build can sometimes be slower than with MkDocs, repeated builds \u2013 especially when serving the site \u2013 are already 4 to 5x faster, as only changed files need to be rebuilt.</p> <p>We're also working on a new Markdown toolchain based on a CommonMark-compliant parser written in Rust, which will make Markdown processing significantly faster. We'll be tackling this as part of the upcoming component system, which we'll start working on in early 2026. Once our new Markdown toolchain is ready, we'll provide automated tools to translate between Python Markdown and CommonMark, so you don't need to manually migrate your content.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/05/zensical/#maximum-compatibility","title":"Maximum compatibility","text":"<p>Compatibility with Material for MkDocs is our top priority.

Therefore, we've put significant effort into ensuring that Zensical understands <code>mkdocs.yml</code> configuration files, so that you can build your projects with minimal changes.</p> <p>This means your existing Markdown files, template overrides, CSS and JavaScript extensions don't need to be touched, primarily because we did not change the generated HTML, and rely on Python Markdown for processing your content.</p> <p>However, plugins are a different story. In MkDocs, practically all plugins have side effects, making it impossible to parallelize builds. We started from first principles and asked: what should extensibility look like in a modern static site generator? Our answer is the upcoming module system, which takes a fundamentally different approach based on four core principles:</p> <ul> <li>Modules can inject, extend, and re-define functionality</li> <li>Modules are deterministic through topological ordering</li> <li>Modules foster reusability, with the possibility to remix them</li> <li>Modules can cooperate through well-defined contracts</li> </ul> <p>We're working on shipping essential functionality as provided by MkDocs plugins as built-in modules.
